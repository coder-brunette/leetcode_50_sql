-- We define query quality as:

-- The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

-- We also define poor query percentage as:

-- The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

-- Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

-- Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

-- Return the result table in any order.


-- Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT query_name, ROUND(AVG(rating / position), 2) AS quality, ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 
/ COUNT(*), 2) AS poor_query_percentage FROM queries WHERE query_name is NOT NULL GROUP BY query_name
